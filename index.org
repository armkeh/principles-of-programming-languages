The slides are available as
- Online [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]] 2-dimensional slideshows,
- printable PDFs, or

** Lecture hand-written notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-anchor-Lecture-hand-written-notes^1
:END:

In some cases, some handwritten notes accompany the slides
during lecture.

When necessary and possible,
those notes are scanned and made available here.
If any are missing that you would like to see, please ask.

* Literate programs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-anchor-Literate-programs^1
:END:

Tutorial sessions and
the last lecture of each week are usually
hands-on live programming sessions.
Partial notes will usually be posted ahead of time,
with some parts code snippets usually excluded
to be filled in during the session.

Literate copies of the programs developed
in those lectures and tutorials are available here.
In some cases the same notes are used
for both a lecture and then a tutorial,
in which case there will likely be updates and additions
between the two.

Particularly relevant portions of raw code may also
be tangled (extracted) into separate files,
and then linked to directly here.

** COMMENT Links template
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-anchor-COMMENT-Links-template^2

# The title should indicate if this was a lecture or tutorial.
