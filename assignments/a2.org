This assignment asks you to construct representation
of a simply-typed λ-calculus, construct a typechecker for that
λ-calculus, and finally to implement /type-erasure/ and a
simple translator to simplify terms to untyped λ-calculus terms.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Informal-description-of-the-expression-language
:END:

The λ-calculus you are to work with during this assignment
we call /ST/, standing for /simply typed/.
It adds to the pure untyped λ-calculus /UL/
terms ~zero~, ~suc~, ~iszero~, ~tt~, ~ff~, and ~test~, with the following syntax.
#+begin_src text
⟨typedterm⟩ ∷= var
             | ⟨typedterm⟩ ⟨typedterm⟩
             | λ var : ⟨type⟩ → ⟨typedterm⟩
             | zero
             | suc ⟨typedterm⟩
             | iszero ⟨typedterm⟩
             | true
             | false
             | test ⟨typedterm⟩ ⟨typedterm⟩ ⟨typedterm⟩

⟨type⟩ ∷= ⟨type⟩ → ⟨type⟩
        | nat
        | bool
#+end_src

We also introduce the following /typing rules/ for these typed λ-terms.
The rules make use of a /typing context/ or /type environment/ Γ.

The first rule says that variables have the type they are given
by the environment Γ (assuming they are given a type at all.)
#+begin_src text
 x : A ∈ Γ
–––––––––––– T-Var
 Γ ⊢ x : A
#+end_src
(Added November 15th) Note that free variables do not have any typing rule,
and so terms involving free variables *do not typecheck*.

The second rule says that if by adding “~x~ has type ~A~” to the environment,
we can conclude that ~t₂~ has type ~B~, then
the term ~λ x : A → t₂~ has type ~A → B~.
(Notice that this rule is the only time we add to the environment.)
#+begin_src text
 Γ,(x : A) ⊢ t : B
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– T-Abs
 Γ ⊢ (λ x : A → t) : A → B
#+end_src

The third rule says that if ~t₁~ has the function type ~A → B~,
and ~t₂~ has the type ~A~, then ~t₂~ applied to ~t₁~ has type ~B~.
#+begin_src text
 Γ ⊢ t₁ : A → B    Γ ⊢ t₂ : A
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– T-App
        Γ ⊢ t₁ t₂ : B
#+end_src

The remaining rules give the typings for the constants and
function terms added to this language.
#+begin_src text
                                   Γ ⊢ t : nat
––––––––––––––––––– T-zero      –––––––––––––––––––– T-suc
 Γ ⊢ zero : nat                  Γ ⊢ suc t : nat
                            
                            
                         
––––––––––––––––––– T-true    –––––––––––––––––––– T-false
 Γ ⊢ true : bool               Γ ⊢ false : bool


    Γ ⊢ t : nat

** Nameless representation of terms
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Nameless-representation-of-terms
:END:

We use /de Bruijn indices/ in place of named variables.
The index “points” to a binder, or to a free variable.
- ~0~ points to the first enclosing variable binder,
  or the first free variable if there are no enclosing binders.
- ~1~ points to the second enclosing variable binder,
  or the ~2-n~'th free variable if there are only ~n~ enclosing binders, ~n ≤ 1~.
- ~2~ points to the third enclosing variable binder,
  or the ~3-n~'th free variable if there are only ~n~ enclosing binders, ~n ≤ 2~.
- …
- ~i~ points to the ~i~'th enclosing variable binder,
  or the ~(i+1)-n~'th free variable if there are only ~n~ enclosing binders, ~n ≤ i~.
- …

This representation avoids any need for renaming variables
during substitution.

It does make terms less human readable;
we can correct for this by writing a /pretty printer/ for λ-terms
(which will be the focus of a homework.)

** Scala implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Scala-implementation
:END:

Pure untyped λ-terms can only be variables, abstractions or applications.
(Updated November 5th) We include as parts of the case classes
overrides of the ~toString~ method, which improve the appearance
of these terms when they are converted to strings.
#+begin_src amm :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.sc
sealed trait ULTerm
case class ULVar(index: Int) extends ULTerm {
  override def toString() = index.toString()
}
case class ULAbs(t: ULTerm) extends ULTerm {
  override def toString() = "lambda . " + t.toString()
}
case class ULApp(t1: ULTerm, t2: ULTerm) extends ULTerm {
  override def toString() = "(" + t1.toString() + ") (" + t2.toString() + ")"
}
#+end_src

The use of de Bruijn indices necessitates a method to
“shift” the indices of free variables up or down;
for instance, when applying a term to an abstraction,
we must shift them up to avoid capturing what should be free variables
in a variable binder.

Shifting is done by walking through the term,
incrementing the variable indices by the shift amount
if their index is greater than the number of enclosing binders.
#+begin_src amm :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.sc
// Shift the numbering of unbound variables
def shift(shiftAmount: Int, t: ULTerm): ULTerm = {
  // Walk through the term and shift all variables with index
  // greater than or equal to c, which is maintained to be
  // the number of variable binders (abstractions) outside the current subterm.
  def walk(currentBinders: Int, t: ULTerm): ULTerm = t match {
    // Check if x is a free variable; that is,
    // if the number x is greater than or equal to
    // the number of variable binders encountered outside this subterm.
    case ULVar(x) if (x >= currentBinders) => ULVar(x+shiftAmount)
    case ULVar(x) => ULVar(x)

    case ULAbs(t) =>
      // We now have one more variable binder outside the subterm.
      // Increment currentBinders and walk into the subterm.
      ULAbs(walk(currentBinders+1, t))

    case ULApp(t1,t2) =>
      // No new variable binders. Just walk into the subterms.
      ULApp(walk(currentBinders,t1),walk(currentBinders,t2))
  }

  // Walk the term and perform the shift of free variables.
  // We begin with 0 variable binders outside.
  walk(0, t)
}
#+end_src

Substitution is similarly defined by “walking” through the term,
but here, when we find variables, we choose whether to “replace them”
by the term being subbed in or not.
We have to adjust the variable being substituted and the
free variables in the term being subbed in according to
the number of variable binders we enter.
#+begin_src amm :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.sc
// In our usual syntax, we would write substitution as `t[x := r]`.
// Here we write `substitute(t,x,r)`.
def substitute(t: ULTerm, x: Int, r: ULTerm): ULTerm = {
  // We want to substitute for the free variable with number x.
  // Inside a variable binder (abstraction),
  // the index of all free variables is shifted up by 1.
  // So we must keep track of the number of binders outside the current subterm.
  def walk(currentBinders: Int, t: ULTerm): ULTerm = t match {
    case ULVar(y) if y == x + currentBinders =>
      // y is the xth free variable. Substitute for it,
      // making sure to shift the free variables in r
      // to account for the number of variable binders outside this subterm.
      shift(currentBinders,r)
    
    case ULVar(y) =>
      // Otherwise, y is not the xth free variable;
      // leave it as is.
      ULVar(y)
    
    case ULAbs(t) =>
      // We now have one more variable binder outside the subterm.
      // Increment currentBinders and walk into the subterm.
      ULAbs(walk(currentBinders+1,t))

    case ULApp(t1,t2) =>
      // No new variable binders. Just walk into the subterms.
      ULApp(walk(currentBinders,t1),walk(currentBinders,t2))
  }

  // Walk the term, performing the substitution.
  // We begin with 0 variable binders outside.
  walk(0,t)
}
#+end_src

We need to check if terms are values for call-by-value semantics.
#+begin_src amm :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.sc
// We need to know if a term is a value during reduction
// when using call-by-value semantics.
def isValue(t: ULTerm): Boolean = t match {
  case ULAbs(_) => true
  case _ => false
}
#+end_src

Those semantics are given by a reduction function,
which reduces terms by one step, and then an evaluation function,
which keeps reducing until we get stuck (/if/ we get stuck;
we might have an infinite reduction sequence.)
#+begin_src amm :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.sc
// Call-by-value reduction function.
// Performs one step of evaluation, if possible according to the call-by-value rules.
// If no reduction is possible, returns None.
def reduce(t: ULTerm): Option[ULTerm] = t match {

  // Case: the left term is an abstraction, and the right is a value.
  // Then apply the value to the abstraction.
  case ULApp(ULAbs(t),v) if isValue(v) =>
    // When we apply the value to the abstraction,
    // we must shift the value's free variables up by 1 to account
    // for the abstraction's variable binder.
    val r = substitute(t,0,shift(1,v))
    // Then, we need to shift the result back.
    // Since the abstraction's variable is now "used up".
    Some(shift(-1,r))

  // Case: the left term is a value, then try to reduce the right term.
  case ULApp(v,t) if isValue(v) =>
    reduce(t) match {
      case Some(r) => Some(ULApp(v,r))
      case None => None
    }

  // Case: the left term is not a value (not an abstraction.)
  // Try to reduce it.
  case ULApp(t1,t2) =>
    reduce(t1) match {
      case Some(r1) => Some(ULApp(r1,t2))
      case None => None
    }
    
  case _ => None
}

// Evaluation just repeatedly applies reduce,
// until we reach None (signifying reduction failed.)
def evaluate(t: ULTerm): ULTerm = reduce(t) match {
  case None => t
  case Some(r) => evaluate(r)
}
#+end_src

** Ruby implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Ruby-implementation
:END:

In Ruby, we use implement /UL/ terms using a (super) class ~ULTerm~ with
subclasses for each kind of /UL/ term.

The super class defines so default methods to keep track
of what kind of term we have.
These could be implemented as fields (instance variables),
but the use of methods implies that these values are constant
for all objects and across all time.
#+begin_src ruby :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.rb
# Our top-level ULTerm class defines some default
# methods to track what kind of term we have
# (which must be overidden in non-default cases)
# as well as the shift, substitute and eval methods
# which are defined in terms of other methods
# defined by the subclasses.
class ULTerm

  # By default, we assume terms are irreducible,
  # not abstractions, and not values.
  # Subclasses which should have these properties
  # must override these methods.
  # (In our basic calculus with call-by-value semantics,
  # only applications are reducible and only abstractions
  # are values. This can be changed for different calculi/semantics.)
  def reduce; nil end
  def absBody; nil end
  def isValue?; false end
#+end_src

We would not usually have enough information in this super ~ULTerm~ class
to be able to define the ~shift~ and ~substitution~ methods,
without resorting to (what I feel is) an ugly approach of using ~is_a?~ to check
whether the term is a variable, abstraction or application.

Previously, we used a local ~walk~ method inside of each of
the methods, which actually carried out the work on the terms.
We could do the same here, repeating the definition of ~walk~ inside of
the ~shift~ and ~substitute~ methods for each type of term
(at least, I believe we can do so.)
However, this repetition of code is very undesirable.

Instead, we take advantage of the fact that the ~walk~ method
was in fact /almost identical/ for both shifting and substitution,
only acting differently on /variables/, to reimagine ~walk~ as
an iterator. This iterator will take as a block argument (a lambda)
the action to carry out on variables.

So, assuming that the ~walk~ method will be defined for each of the subclasses,
we can define ~shift~ and ~substitute~ here in the superclass
by writing the action to take on variables as a block,
and calling ~walk~ on the term with that action.
#+begin_src ruby :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.rb
  # Shifting is just walking, where in the base case,
  # we either increment the variable by shiftAmount or
  # leave it alone.
  def shift(shiftAmount)
    # walk is an iterator.
    # The block tells us what to do with variables.
    walk(0) { |x,currentBinders|
      if x >= currentBinders
        ULVar.new(x+shiftAmount)
      else
        ULVar.new(x)
      end }
  end

  # Substitution is just walking, where we either
  # replace the variable, or leave it alone.
  def substitute(x,r)
    walk(0) { |y,currentBinders|
      if y == x + currentBinders
        r
      else
        ULVar.new(y)
      end }
  end
#+end_src

Similarly to how we assume above that the ~walk~ method
will be defined for all subclasses, we also assume
that the ~reduce~ method will be defined for all subclasses,
since we lack a nice means to define it here.
However, we can easily define ~eval~ in terms of those ~reduce~ methods.
#+begin_src ruby :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.rb
  def eval
    r = nil
    r_next = self
    # Keep reducing until it fails (reduce returns nil.)
    # This is the recommended "do...while" form in Ruby.
    loop do
      r = r_next
      r_next = r.reduce
      break unless r_next
    end

    return r
  end
end
#+end_src

As mentioned above, in each of the subclasses of ~ULTerm~,
we need to define the ~walk~ and ~reduce~ methods.
But for variables, reduction is undefined, so we
do not define that method here.
(We do define here and below ~to_s~ methods, to allow
these terms to be printed somewhat nicely.)
#+begin_src ruby :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.rb
class ULVar < ULTerm
  attr_reader :index

  # We require our variables are only indexed by integers.
  def initialize(i)
    unless i.is_a?(Integer)
      throw "Constructing a lambda term out of non-lambda terms"
    end
    @index = i
  end
  
  def walk(currentBinders,&block)
    # This is a variable. Run the code in &block.
    # (yield does this; it "yields" control to the block.)
    yield(@index, currentBinders)
  end

  def to_s
    @index.to_s
  end

  def ==(r); r.is_a?(ULVar) && r.index == @index end
end
#+end_src

Again, we cannot ~reduce~ an abstraction,
so we do not define that method here.
But we do set override the ~absBody~ and ~isValue?~ methods
since this is an abstraction, and abstractions are values.
#+begin_src ruby :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.rb
class ULAbs < ULTerm
  attr_reader :t

  def initialize(t)
    unless t.is_a?(ULTerm)
      throw "Constructing a lambda term out of a non-lambda term"
    end
    @t = t
  end
  
  def walk(currentBinders,&block)
    # Increment the local variable counter within the variable binder.
    t = @t.walk(currentBinders+1,&block)
    ULAbs.new(t)
  end

  # Abstractions are an abstraction (of course),
  # with body @t,
  # and are also considered values.
  def absBody; @t end
  def isValue?; true end
  
  def to_s
    "lambda . " + @t.to_s
  end

  def ==(r); r.is_a?(ULAbs) && r.t == @t end
end
#+end_src

The application subclass is actually the only one
where we define the ~reduce~ method.
The logic of it is the same as in the Scala version,
though unfortunately the lack of pattern matching
makes it appear much worse.
(The source code was edited November 6th to remove some
diagnostic printing statements which were unfortunately included previously.)
#+begin_src ruby :tangle ./src/a2_ulterm.rb
class ULApp < ULTerm
  attr_reader :t1
  attr_reader :t2

  def initialize(t1,t2)
    unless t1.is_a?(ULTerm) && t2.is_a?(ULTerm)
      throw "Constructing a lambda term out of non-lambda terms"
    end
    @t1 = t1; @t2 = t2
  end
  
  def walk(currentBinders,&block)
    t1 = @t1.walk(currentBinders,&block)
    t2 = @t2.walk(currentBinders,&block)
    ULApp.new(t1,t2)
  end

  # Applications can be reduced.
  def reduce
    if @t1.absBody && @t2.isValue?
      body = @t1.absBody
      (body.substitute(0,@t2.shift(1))).shift(-1)
    elsif @t1.isValue?
      r = @t2.reduce
      if r
        ULApp.new(@t1,r)
      else
        nil
      end
    else
      r = @t1.reduce
      if r
        ULApp.new(r,@t2)
      else
        nil
      end
    end
  end

  def to_s
    "(" + @t1.to_s + ") (" + @t2.to_s + ")" 
  end

  def ==(r); r.is_a?(ULApp) && r.t1 == @t1 && r.t2 == @t2 end
end
#+end_src

One important fact bears mentioning about our implementation
of ~ULTerm~ and its subclasses: note that all of the fields
of each class are read-only, and that their values
are only ever set in the constructors.
These are /value classes/; a ~ULTerm~ object is intended to be
(and will be, barring any misuse) /immutable/ (unchanging over time.)

This design leads to better predictability of code;
there should never be an instance where a ~ULTerm~ changes unexpectedly
because of some method call, because ~ULTerm~'s never change
after their creation.

The following code snippets show how you might use
these implementations to perform some simple computations.

In Scala:
#+begin_src amm
// The term "lambda x . lambda y . lambda z . u (x (y z))"

// Now substitute that term itself in for the free variable.

*Place your code for this part in the files ~a2.sc~ and ~a2.rb~.*
#+end_center

Implement, in both Scala and Ruby,
a type ~STTerm~ to represent terms of the λ-calculus /ST/ defined above.

The constructors of the type should be named
- ~STVar~,
- ~STApp~,
- ~STAbs~ (see the note below regarding the new argument to this constructor),
- ~STZero~,
- ~STSuc~,
- ~STIsZero~,
- ~STTrue~,
- ~STFalse~, and
- ~STTest~.

(The remaining text of this section was added November 10th.)

The ~STZero~, ~STTrue~ and ~STFalse~ types should be declared as
singleton classes in Scala (i.e., as ~case object~'s instead of ~case class~'s.)

Note that the ~STAbs~ constructor must take an argument specifying
the /type/ of the variable being abstracted. This argument
should be of the following types.
(This code should be included in your ~a2~ file.)

(Added November 15th) You are not expected to, and should not,
extend this type at all; you are to implement
the type ~STTerm~ (/Term/, not /Type/) which /uses/ ~STType~ as a parameter
to the ~STAbs~ subtype.

* Part 2 – Typechecking                                        [40 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-1-–-Interpreter-written-in-Scala--[20 marks]
:END:

#+begin_center
*Place your code for this part in the files ~a2.sc~ and ~a2.rb~.*
#+end_center

Implement, in both Scala and Ruby,
a /typechecker/ method named ~typecheck~ for elements of ~STTerm~.

This ~typecheck~ method takes an ~STTerm~, and returns ~true~ if
the represented term obeys the type rules of /ST/;
otherwise, it returns ~false~.

(The remaining text of this section was added November 10th.)

The definition of ~typecheck~ will require a method to determine
the type of a given expression.
The name ~typeOf~ is recommended for this method.
This method should have as an argument the /environment/ or /typing context/;
i.e., a map, list or similar type which relates variables to types. 
(Since variables are represented as integers,
this means relating integers to ~STType~ values.)

(Added November 15th) Note that the ~typeOf~ method is simply an implementation
of the typing rules described in part 0.1.

I (Mark) /suggest/ that ~typeOf~ method return a ~Option[STType]~ in the Scala implementation,
but this is not a requirement.
You will not be penalised for using any reasonable implementation,
including
- use of exceptions when a term has no type,
- use of the ~Try~, ~Success~ and ~Failure~ types, or
- use of the ~Either~ type.
If you have another implementation in mind, you are welcome to check
with Mark.

(Added November 15th) For example (using the syntax for terms from part 0.1),
and assuming that ~typeOf~ takes a list parameter as the environment,
- ~typecheck(true)~ should return ~true~, because ~typeOf(true,[])~ returns ~bool~.
  - (Note: ~[]~ is passed as the environment in all these cases,
    because when you start typechecking,
    there are no variables added to the environment.
    You will need a similar “empty environment” for
    whatever representation you choose for the environment.)
- ~typecheck(suc(zero))~ should return ~true~,
  because ~typeOf(suc(zero),[])~ returns ~nat~.
- ~typecheck(λ x : nat → x)~ should return ~true~,
  because the variable in the abstraction has been
  stated to have the type ~nat~,
  so ~typeOf(λ x : nat → x,[])~ should return ~nat → nat~.
  - That is, ~STFun(STNat,STNat)~ in Scala
    or ~STFun.new(STNat.new,STNat.new)~ in Ruby.
- ~typecheck(λ x : nat → y)~ should return ~false~,
  because the variable ~y~ in the abstraction is free and so
  does not have any type information,
  so ~typeOf(λ x : nat → y,[])~ should fail.
- ~typecheck((λ x : nat → x)(zero))~ should return ~true~,
  because ~typeOf((λ x : nat → x)(zero),[])~ should return ~nat~.
- ~typecheck((λ x : nat → x)(false))~ should return ~false~,
  because there is a typeclash, so ~typeOf((λ x : nat → x)(false),[])~ should fail.
All of these are in line with the typing rules described in part 0.1.

* Part 3 – Translation to the untyped λ-calculus; type erasure [40 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-2-–-Interpreter-written-in-Prolog-[20 marks]
:END:

#+begin_center
*Place your code for this part in the files ~a2.sc~ and ~a2.rb~.*
#+end_center

Implement, in both Scala and Ruby,
a method ~eraseTypes~ for elements of ~STTerm~,
which /translates/ them into elements of ~ULTerm~ (definition given above.)

This translation also needs to translate the natural and boolean constants
into the pure λ-calculus encodings that represent them.
Recall these translations from the notes (the translation for ~iszero~ has been added.)
#+begin_src text
true   = λ t → λ f → t
false  = λ t → λ f → f
test   = λ l → λ m → λ n → l m n
zero   = λ s → λ z → z
suc    = λ n → λ s → λ z → s (n s z)
iszero = λ m → m (λ x → false) true     
#+end_src
Bear in mind that application is left-associative, so, e.g., ~l m n~ is
equivalent to ~(l m) n~.

(You should import the ~a2_ulterm~ files into your file
in a manner compatible with the Docker testing environments,
or copy the definitions into your file and create
blank ~a2_ulterm~ files to satisfy the import statements in the testing.)

#+begin_center
*Place any code for this part in files ~a2p4.sc~ and ~a2p4.rb~.*
#+end_center

Implement an evaluation method for your ~STTerm~ type.

Make use of the evaluation method for ~ULTerm~'s in your definition.
You will also need a method to convert results back
to an ~STTerm~ representation.

(Added November 20th) If you prefer, you may instead
implement evaluation directly for ~STTerm~'s; that is,
without making use of the ~ULTerm~ evaluation method.
(This option is being added as it is still
and interesting extra piece of work.)

Implement another λ-calculus, called /ST2/, which includes
the type of /pairs/ as well as naturals and booleans,
along with a type checker, type eraser and evaluation method.
