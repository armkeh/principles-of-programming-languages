* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction
:END:

This assignment asks you to construct interpreters
for a simple language of mathematical expressions.
To put it another way, you are asked to construct simple calculators.

We provide an informal description of the language below.
Your task is to then represent the terms of the language
in Scala and Prolog, using the languages' facilities for
representing such data.

- *A documentation requirement has been added!*
  - As part of the boilerplate, which is now in place.
- A submission checklist was added near the end of this file
  to help bring attention to the documentation requirement.
- The testing code is now given for the Scala portions.
  - The scripts and the Prolog code should come soon.
- The instructions to use a “~Simple~” constructor in
  the Scala types of parts 3 and 4 have been removed.
  Instead, the constructors from part 1 should be repeated.
  - (I had been over-eager in trying to avoid repetition,
    and somehow failed to realise that the use of the “~Simple~”
    constructor would rule out most interesting expressions 🙁.)
- Instructions are now given at the beginning of each part
  as to the filenames.
- The naming of the types and the interpretation functions/predicates
  has also been standardised.
- The word “task” has been replaced by “part”.

* Informal description of the expression language
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Informal-description-of-the-expression-language
:END:

The language consists of integer constants and seven /prefix/ operators.
- The unary operator ~const~ which operates on integers.
- The unary operators ~neg~ (negative) and ~abs~ (absolute value)
  which operate on expressions of this language.
- The binary operators ~plus~, ~times~, ~minus~ and ~exp~ (exponent)
  which operator on expressions of this language.

The fact that all the operators are prefix
means that this language does not admit ambiguity;
that is, even without using parentheses,
there is only one possible reading of a given expression.

** Example 1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Example-1
:END:

As an example of a syntactically correct expression, consider
#+begin_src text
abs minus abs const 5 abs const 6
#+end_src
which, if we parenthesised the expression and dropped the ~const~'s, would read
#+begin_src text
(abs (minus (abs 5) (abs 6)))
#+end_src
or, in the usual notation,
#+begin_src latex
$|(|5| - |6|)|$
#+end_src

** Example 2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Example-2
:END:

As an additional example, consider
#+begin_src text
plus plus plus exp const 1 const 2 exp const 2 const 2
    exp const 3 const 2 exp const 4 const 2
#+end_src
which, if we parenthesised the expression and dropped the ~const~'s, would read
#+begin_src text
(plus (plus (plus (exp 1 2) (exp 2 2)) (exp 3 2)) (exp 4 2))
#+end_src
or, in the usual notation,
#+begin_src latex
(((1² + 2²) + 3²) + 4²)
#+end_src

* Part 1 – Interpreter written in Scala  [20 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-1-–-Interpreter-written-in-Scala--[20 marks]
:END:

#+begin_center
*Place your code for this part in a file ~a1p1.sc~.*
#+end_center

** 1.1 Representation [5 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1.1-Representation-[5 marks]
:END:

Create a representation of the above described expressions
in Scala using the standard approach for algebraic datatypes,
and call this type ~Expr~.

Name your constructors after the operators,
of course capitalising the names.

So the expression
#+begin_src text
abs minus abs const 5 abs const 6
#+end_src
should be represented using your type as
#+begin_src amm
Abs(Minus(Abs(Const(5)), Abs(Const(6))))
#+end_src

** 1.2 Interpreter    [15 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1.2-Interpreter----[15 marks]
:END:

Define a method ~interpretExpr~ acting on ~Expr~ which
calculates the value of an ~Expr~.

* Part 2 – Interpreter written in Prolog [20 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-2-–-Interpreter-written-in-Prolog-[20 marks]
:END:

#+begin_center
*Place your code for this part in a file ~a1p2.pl~.*
#+end_center

** 2.1 Expression recogniser [5 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1.1-Expression-recogniser-[5 marks]
:END:

Define a predicate ~isExpr~ in Prolog which recognises
trees which represent the above defined expressions.

The labels on the trees should be the name of the operation
appended by ~E~ (in order to avoid any clash with builtin predicates
of the same name.)

So the expression
#+begin_src text
abs minus abs const 5 abs const 6
#+end_src
would be represented in Prolog as
#+begin_src prolog
absE(minusE(absE(constE(5)), absE(constE(6))))
#+end_src
and the query ~isExpr(absE(minusE(absE(constE(5)), absE(constE(6)))))~ would
result in the response ~true~.

** 2.2 Interpreter           [15 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1.2-Interpreter-----------[15 marks]
:END:

Define a binary predicate ~interpretExpr~ which
relates these expressions to their numerical values.

That is, querying ~interpretExpr(e,X)~ should
receive the response ~X = n~ where ~n~ is
the integer value of the expression.

Do not concern yourself with the other direction;
that is, we are not expecting queries
of the form ~interpretExpr(X,n)~ to result in an answer.
(If you can, “fail gracefully”,
i.e., either throw a more meaningful exception
or avoid an exception altogether
but this is not expected even as a bonus.)

* Part 3 – Variables and substitution    [30 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-3-–-Variables-and-substitution----[30 marks]
:END:

#+begin_center
*Place your code for this part in files ~a1p3.sc~ and ~a1p3.pl~.*
#+end_center

** Part 3 description
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-3-description
:END:

In this part, we wish to add variables to our expressions.

This can be done by adding a new operator ~var~ to our expressions,
which operates on symbols representing variable names
(prolog has atoms which can be used a symbols,
and Scala has a ~Symbol~ type. The reason why symbols
are a better candidate than strings will be discussed
when we discuss types.)

However, adding this operator introduces a problem
with our ~interpretExpr~ method/predicate:
how do we interpret a variable when we don't know its value?

Our solution in this assignment is to
introduce a /substitution/ operator,
which takes three values:
1. an expression to perform the substitution on,
2. the variable to be substituted, and
3. the expression to substitute for the variable.

For instance,
#+begin_src text
subst var x x const 6
#+end_src
would be written, using our usual mathematical syntax, as
#+begin_src text
x[x ≔ 6]
#+end_src
It should interpet to just ~6~.

(An alternate solution,
instead of building variable substitution into the language,
would be to add a /state/ argument to ~interpretExpr~,
which maps variables to values.
We will use states in later assignments for this purpose.)

** The part 3
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-part-3
:END:

In Scala, create a new algebraic datatype ~VarExpr~ and a new
interpretation method ~interpretVarExpr~ in Scala ([15 marks].)
Your new constructors should be called ~Var~ and ~Subst~.
+You should reuse your existing ~Expr~ type when defining ~VarExpr~,+
+by including a constructor ~Simple~ which takes a ~Expr~ argument.+
(Edited October 13th.)
You should also repeat the constructors from the part 1
as constructors for this new type.

In Prolog, create a new recognising predicate ~isVarExpr~ which
recognising valid expressions in this extended language,
with the new labels being the operator names given in the description,
and a new predicate ~interpretVarExpr~ which relates
expressions to their interpreted value ([15 marks].)

#+begin_center
*Pay attention when implementing the interpretation of substitution!*
*Review the concept of variable binding,*
*and do not substitute instances of the variable name*
*which are bound elsewhere!*
#+end_center

(This note added October 13th.)
Note: you are allowed and encouraged to collect any helper methods,
for instance a definition of exponentiation,
in a separate file which is imported into your files for the
different parts of this assignment.
Just ensure you use Ammonite-compatible import directives
in your Scala code.

*** Hint (added October 13th)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Hint-(added-October-13th)
:END:

#+begin_center
*You may need to define a helper function/predicate*
*before you can define interpretation here.*
#+end_center

* Part 4 – Boolean expressions           [30 marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-4-–-Boolean-expressions-----------[30 marks]
:END:

#+begin_center
*Place your code for this part in files ~a1p4.sc~ and ~a1p4.pl~.*
#+end_center

** Part 4 description
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-4-description
:END:

In this part, we create an alternate extension to
our first language of expressions
(that is, we build on to ~Expr~, not ~VarExpr~.)

Our goal here is to add
a second /type/ of expressions to the language.
Namely, we are adding booleans.

The new operators are
the 0-ary ~tt~ and ~ff~ (0-ary meaning taking no arguments),
the unary ~bnot~ and the binary ~band~ and ~bor~.

For example, we have the new expression
#+begin_src text
bnot band tt bor ff tt
#+end_src
which in our usual notation would be written
#+begin_src text
¬ (true ∧ (false ∨ true))
#+end_src

These expressions cannot legally be allowed to mix
with integer expressions; that is,
trying to apply a integer operator to a boolean expression
or vice versa is not legal.

** The part 4
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-part-4
:END:

In Scala, create a new algebraic datatype ~MixedExpr~ and a new
interpretation method ~interpretMixedExpr~ in Scala ([15 marks].)
Your new constructors should be named ~TT~, ~FF~, ~Band~, ~Bor~ and ~Bnot~.
+You should again reuse your existing ~Expr~ type when defining ~TypedExpr~,+
+by including a constructor ~IntExpr~ which takes a ~Expr~ argument.+
Your interpreter should return an ~Option[Either[Int,Boolean]]~.
The ~Option~ type is used to handle failure in the case
of a “mixed” expression.
The ~Either~ type is used to handle two possible return types.

(Edited October 13th.)
As in part 3, you will need to repeat the constructors from the
~Expr~ type in part 1 in this type's definition.

In Prolog, create a new recognising predicate ~isMixedExpr~ which
recognises valid expressions in this extended language,
with the new labels being the operator names given in the description,
and a new predicate ~interpretMixedExpr~ which relates
expressions to their interpreted value ([15 marks].)

* Part 5 – Bonus: parsing                [10 bonus marks]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Part-5-–-Bonus-------------------[10 bonus_marks]
:END:

#+begin_center
*Place your code for the bonus, if you attempt it, in ~a1p5.sc~ and/or ~a1p5.pl~.*
#+end_center

Create a /parser/ for the first language of expressions
in this assignment, both in Scala and in Prolog
(partial marks for implementing it in just one language.)

A parser will take as argument a string such as
#+begin_src text
abs minus abs const 5 abs const 6
#+end_src
and return an ~Expr~ representing the expression in that string.

You will likely want to first define a /lexer/ for the language,
that converts a string to a list of lexemes
(to do this, you will need to represent lexemes somehow.)
Such a list is far easier to match over than a string.

The tests can be run by placing the test files
in the same directory as your code files.

To run the tests for the Scala portions, use the commands
#+begin_src shell
amm a1pn_test.sc
#+end_src
where the ~n~ in ~a1pn_test.sc~ is the appropriate part number.

To run the tests for the Prolog portions,us the commands
#+begin_src shell
swipl -t "load_test_files([]), run_tests." -s a1pn.pl
#+end_src
where the ~n~ in ~a1pn.pl~ is the appropriate part number.
