** Image creation post-processing

We need to prepend the images resulting from ~dot~ code blocks
with a LaTeX attribute to resize them, or else they run off the page.
This named code block for this task is taken from
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html][the Org manual]], augmented to allow for centering.
We should always provide ~*this*~ for the ~data~ argument.
as in ~:post attr_wrap(data=*this*)~,
and also always set ~:exports results :results drawer~.
If we don't put the results in the drawer, they will pile up
as we evaluate the code block.

* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction
:END:

In this section we construct our first simple programming language,
an untyped λ-calculus (lambda calculus).

More specifically, we construct a λ-calculus
without (static) type checking (enforcement),
but including the natural numbers and booleans.

** What is the λ-calculus?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: What-is-the-λ-calculus?
:END:

The λ-calculus is, put simply,
a notation for forming and applying functions.
- Because the function (procedure, method, subroutine) abstraction
  gives us a means of representing control flow,
  if we have a means of representing data,
  the λ-calculus is a Turing-complete model of computation.

** History
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: History
:END:

The (basic) λ-calculus as we know it was famously invented
by Alonzo Church in the 1920s.
- This was one culmination of a great deal of work by
  mathematicians investigating the foundations of mathematics.

As mentioned, the λ-calculus is a Turing-complete model of computation.
- Other models proposed around the same time include
  - the Turing machine itself (due to Alan Turing), and
  - the general recursive functions (due to Stephen Cole Kleene.)
- Hence the “Church” in the “Church-Turing thesis”.

The λ-calculus has since seen widespread use in the study and design
of programming languages.
- It is useful both as a simple programming language, and
- as a mathematical object about which statements can be proved.

** Descendents of the λ-calculus
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Descendents-of-the-λ-calculus
:END:

Pure functional programming languages are clearly descended
from the λ-calculus; the λ-calculus embodies their model of computation.
- Additionally, it is common to have a “lambda” operator
  which allows definition of anonymous functions.
  - This is so even outside of pure functional languages,
    - and it is becoming common
      in primarily imperative languages as well!
  
Imperative languages instead (traditionally) use a model of computation
based on the /Von-Neumann/ architecture,
- which matches our real-world computing devices!
  - Hence imperative languages are naturally lower-level;
    one level of abstraction closer to the real computer
    that functional languages, which must be translated
    to imperative code in order to run.
- This model of computation is a natural extension
  of the Turing machine, rather than the λ-calculus
  or recursive functions.
  
* The basics
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-basics
:END:

** Preamble                                    :ignore:

In our discussion of abstractions, we mentioned
the abstraction of the function/method/procedure/subroutine.
- The functional abstraction provides a means
  to represent control flow.

In its pure version, every term in the λ-calculus
is a function.
- In order for such a system to be at all useful,
  it must of course support higher-order functions;
  functions may be applied to functions.
- Values such as booleans and natural numbers
  are /encoded/ (represented) by functions.

** Informal definition of terms
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-terms
:END:

The pure untyped λ-calculus has just three sort of terms;
- variables such as $x$, $y$, $z$,
- /λ-abstractions/, of the form $λ x → t$,
  - (it is also common to use $․$ in place of $→$;
    we prefer $→$ as it emphasises that these are functions)
  - where $x$ is a variable and $t$ is a λ-term, and
- applications of the form $t u$
  - where $t$ and $u$ are λ-terms.

** Informal meaning of terms
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Informal-meaning-of-terms
:END:

The meaning of each term is, informally:
- A λ-abstraction $λ x → t$ represents a function of one argument,
  which, when applied to a term $u$, substitutes
  all free occurrences of $x$ in $t$ with $u$.
- An application applies the term $u$ to the function (term) $t$.
- A variable on its own (a free variable) has no further meaning.
  - Variables are intended to be /bound/.
  - “Top-level” free variables have no meaning (on their own).
    - Until we construct a new term by λ-abstracting them.

** Variable binding
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Variable-binding;-free-and-bound-variables
:END:

Recall the notion of free and bound variables.
- A /variable binder/ is an operator which operates on
  some number of /variables/ as well as /terms/.
  - Examples include quantifiers
    such as $∀\_❙\_•\_$, $∃\_❙\_•\_$ and $∑\_❙\_•\_$,
    and substitution $\_[\_→\_]$.
  - By convention, the bodies of variable binders extend as far
    to the right as possible;
    - so for instance $∀ x ❙ P x • Q x ∧ R y$ is read
      as $(∀ x ❙ P x • (Q x ∧ R y))$.
  - But substitution binds tighter than any other operation;
   - so for instance $x + y [y ≔ z]$ is read as $x + (y [y ≔ z])$ 

** Free and bound variables

For simplicity, let us assume here that variable binders
act on a single variable and a single term.
- Let $B\_•\_$ range over the set of variable binders in a language.
- An occurrence of a variable $x$ in a term $t$ that is /not/ in
  a subterm of the form $B x • u$ is called /free/.
- In a term $t$ with a subterm of the form $B x • u$,
  all free occurrences of the variable $x$ that occur within $u$
  are /bound/ by that instance of the binder $B$.
  - Note: instances of $x$ which are bound elsewhere are not bound
    by that $B$.

** Open and closed terms; combinators

- A λ-term which contains free variables is called an /open term/.

- A λ-term with no free variables is called a /closed term/.
  - Such λ-terms are also called /combinators/.

** Representing functions with multiple arguments
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Representing-functions-with-multiple-arguments
:END:

You may have noticed that our method for constructing function
in the λ-calculus (the λ-abstraction)
only allows us to construct single-argument functions.
- That is, we do not have terms such as $λ(x,y) → t$.
- This may seem restrictive,
- but it turns out to be sufficient.
  And it keeps the language simpler theoretically.

** Currying
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Currying
:END:

Rather than complicating our set of terms by admitting
functions of multiple arguments, we use the technique
of /currying/ functions.
- Consider a function $f : A × B → C$.
- We can substitute a new function $f′ : A → (B → C)$
  for $f$.
  - (By convention, function arrows associate to the right,
    so this is equivalent to $f : A → B → C$.)
  - So $f′$ is a function which takes an $A$ and
    /produces a function/ of type $B → C$.
    - We also say that $f′$ is /partially applied/ to a value of $A$.
    - We usually don't give this new function a name.
    - We can consider this new function as having a /fixed/ value
      for the $A$ argument that was provided.
    - (So we must be able to represent higher-order functions
      to use Currying.)

** Examples of λ-terms
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Examples-of-λ-terms
:END:

#+begin_src text
λ x → x
#+end_src
is a familiar function; it is the /identity/ function.
We will use the name ~id~ to refer to this function.

#+begin_src text
λ x → λ y → x
#+end_src
is a function which ignores its second argument,
and just returns the first; this is sometimes called ~const~.

#+begin_src text
λ x → λ y → y
#+end_src
is then a function which ignores its first argument.

#+begin_src text
λ f → λ x → f x
#+end_src
is a function which applies its second argument to its first;
we might call this just ~apply~.

* The syntax and semantics of /UL/
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-formal-syntax-and-semantics-of-/UL/
:END:

** Preamble                                    :ignore:

We now discuss the formal semantics of the untyped λ-calculus;
that is, we
- give a grammar for its syntax, and
- define operational semantics for the language.

** A grammar for /UL/
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: A-grammar-for-/UL/
:END:

#+begin_src text
⟨term⟩ ∷= var | λ var → ⟨term⟩ | ⟨term⟩ ⟨term⟩
#+end_src

In the case that we are restricted to ASCII characters,
we will write abstraction as
#+begin_src text
“lambda” var . ⟨term⟩
#+end_src

** The operational semantics of /UL/
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-operational-semantics-of-/UL/
:END:

A term of the form $(λ x → t₁) t₂$ is called a /redex/ (β-redex),
meaning /reducible expression/.

The semantics of the λ-calculus is given by a /reduction strategy/
(/β/-reduction strategy);
- A reduction (β-reduction) transforms a subterm of the form
  - $(λ x → t₁) t₂$ (a redex) to
  - $t₁[x ≔ t₂]$.
    - (There are various syntactic representations of substitutions;
      we prefer to the substitution operation to come after the term
      where the substitution is carried out ($t₁$), and to use
      the “becomes” operator to imply free instance of $x$ become $t₂$. 
    - Pierce instead uses the form $[x ↦ t₂]t₁$, with the
      substitution operation coming before the term,
      and using the “maps to” operator instead of “becomes”.
    - You may also see forms such as $[x\backslash t₁]$ or $[t₁/x]$.)

** Normal forms and values

A term which does not involve any redexes is said to be
in /normal form/ (β-normal form).
- Terms in β-normal form which are not variables
  are called /values/.
  - In the pure untyped λ-calculus, these only include λ-abstractions.
  - Later, we will add other constant values,
    such as ~true~, ~false~, ~0~, etc.

In the untyped λ-calculus,
- if a term has a normal form, that normal form is unique.
  - (By the /Church–Rosser/ theorem.)
- But not all terms have a normal form!
    
** Some reduction strategies
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Reduction-strategies
:END:

Given an arbitrary term, there may be several subterms which are redexes,
- so we have a choice of what subterm to reduce.
A reduction strategy limits our choice of which redex to reduce.

Several strategies have been studied. We discuss just four of them.
- full β-reduction, normal order,
- call by name, and call by value.
We only give a full formal treatment to call-by-value.
  
The last two you may know as names of parameter passing methods
from (practical) programming languages.
- There is a direct correspondance between reduction strategies
  and parameter passing methods.

** Some reduction strategies: full β-reduction and normal order
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Reduction-strategies:-full-β-reduction
:END:

The /full β-reduction/ strategy is, essentially, to have no
strategy at all.
- Under full β-reduction, and redex can be reduced at any point.
- This strategy gives rise to a reduction /relation/,
  not a function.
  - Since a given term may reduce to /many/ other terms.
  
The /normal order/ strategy enforces that the
leftmost, outermost redex is always reduced first.
- This restriction gives rise to a function.

** Some reduction strategies: call by name and call by value
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Reduction-strategies:-call-by-name
:END:

The /call by name/ strategy builds on the normal order strategy
- by mandating that no reductions take place inside abstractions.
- So “arguments cannot be evaluated before being applied”.
  
The /call by value/ strategy also builds on the normal order strategy,
- by mandating that a redex is reduced only when its right hand side
  - (the “argument”)
  is a value (in β-normal form and not a variable).

** A formal description of call by value semantics

Let us use the convention that variable names involving
- ~t~ represent arbitrary λ-terms, whereas variable names involving
- ~v~ represent terms in λ-normal form (values).

Then we may give a formal description of call-by-value semantics
using inference rules.
#+begin_src text
   t₁ ⟶ t₁′
–––––––––––––––– Appˡ
t₁ t₂ ⟶ t₁′ t₂


   t₂ ⟶ t₂′
–––––––––––––––– Appʳ
v₁ t₂ ⟶ v₁ t₂′

   
–––––––––––––––––––––––– AppAbs
(λ x → t) v ⟶ t[x ≔ v]
#+end_src
Notice how the use of ~t~'s and ~v~'s mandates that
- terms on the left reduce first, and
- applications only take place when the term being applied is a value.

** β-reduction, α-equivalence and η-conversion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: α-conversion,-β-reduction-and-η-conversion
:END:

β-reduction gives us one way to equate terms;
- two terms “have the same value” if they both reduce to the same
  value (irreducible term.)
- So we call terms that reduce to the same value
  β-equivalent.
  - For instance, $(λ x → x) y =_{β} y$.

Two other notions of equality between λ-terms prove useful.
- α-equivalence stipulates that two terms which vary
  only in the naming of bound variables are equivalent.
  - For instance, $λ x → x =_{α} λ y → y$.
  - This is a very useful stipulation to help avoid
    name clashes! 
- η-conversion stipulates that
  - a term of the form $λ x → f x$ can be reduced to $f$,
    (η-reduction)
    and conversely,
  - a term of the form $f$ can be expanded to $λ x → f x$
    (η-expansion.)
    
** Strong and weak normalisation

As we've said, a λ-term is said to be
in /normal form/ if it cannot be reduced.
- We can define this concept of normal form
  in any system in which terms reduce;
  - in particular, in all the other models of computation
    we will consider.

A set of terms along with a reduction strategy is then called
- /strongly normalising/ if every reduction sequence is guaranteed
  to terminate in a normal form, and
- /weakly normalising/ if for every term, there is at least one
  reduction sequence which terminates in a normal form.

** Exercise: a term with no normal form

One combinator (closed term) of the untyped λ-calculus
is the /ω-combinator/, which is also called the /divergent/ combinator.
#+begin_src text
omega = (λ x → x x) (λ x → x x)
#+end_src

This combinator has no normal form; can you prove that?

Hint: what reductions are possible here?
What is the result of that reduction?

* λ-encodings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: λ-encodings
:END:

** Preamble                                    :ignore:

As mentioned previously, in the pure λ-calculus,
every term is a function.
- There are no basic types of data.

So, we must have a way of representing any data as
a function.
- We call these Church encodings.

We will show how to do this for
- booleans,
- pairs, and
- natural numbers,
and give some “combinators” which operate on these kinds of data.

** Church booleans

We define the following terms to represent boolean values.
- ~tru~ represents truth, and
- ~fls~ represents false.
#+begin_src text
tru = λ t → λ f → t
fls = λ t → λ f → f
#+end_src

These choices are /somewhat/ arbitrary.
- We could choose any two distinct λ-terms.
- But they are not really arbitrary;
  these two terms embody the idea that a boolean value
  is a “choice” between two options.
  - ~tru~, when given two arguments, “chooses” the first.
  - ~fls~, when given two arguments, “chooses” the second.

** Defining ~if-then-else~ using Church booleans

Since the Church encoded booleans already “perform” a choice,
defining an “if-then-else” construct
using them is quite straightforward.
#+begin_src text
test = λ l → λ m → λ n → l m n
#+end_src
The intention is that
- the first argument is a Church boolean,
- the second is the “then” branch, and
- the third is the “else” branch. 

Notice that ~test b v w~ simply reduces to ~b v w~;
- the boolean ~b~ really “does the work”
  of choosing between ~v~ and ~w~.

** Exercise: is ~test~ really if-then-else?

Let us briefly pause to consider the semantics of ~test~,
- and see if it matches the behaviour
  we expect from an “if-then-else” construct.

Consider the example λ-term
#+begin_src text
test true (id true) (id false)
#+end_src

Using call-by-value semantics, we have
#+begin_src text
  test true (id true) (id false)
= test true ((λ x → x) (λ x → λ y → x)) ((λ x → x) (λ x → λ y → y))
⟶ test true (λ x → λ y → x) ((λ x → x) (λ x → λ y → y))
⟶ test true (λ x → λ y → x) (λ x → λ y → y)
= test true true false
⟶ …
#+end_src

Exercise: Considering this portion of the reduction sequence,
what is different about ~test~ and the “if-then-else” construct
that you are used to?

** Pairs

We now give an encoding of pairs
- (a wrapping of two terms into one),
- along with pair “deconstructors”.
These definitions rely upon the encoding of booleans
we have just given.

#+begin_src text
pair = λ f → λ s → λ b → b f s
fst = λ p → p tru
snd = λ p → p fls
#+end_src

We may check that, for instance, ~fst (pair v w)~ will indeed
reduce to ~v~, using call-by-value semantics.
#+begin_src text
  fst (pair v w)
= (λ p → p (λ x → λ y → x)) ((λ f → λ s → λ b → b f s) v w)
⟶ (λ p → p (λ x → λ y → x)) ((      λ s → λ b → b v s)   w)
⟶ (λ p → p (λ x → λ y → x)) ((            λ b → b v w))
⟶ (λ b → b v w) (λ x → λ y → x)
→ (λ x → λ y → x) v w
⟶ (λ y → v) w
→ v
#+end_src

** Exercise: ~snd~

As an exercise, you may confirm
that ~snd (pair v w)~ reduces to ~w~, using call-by-value semantics.

** Natural numbers: Church numerals

To represent natural numbers is only slightly more complicated
than booleans and pairs. We give the pattern
#+begin_src text
c₀ = λ s → λ z → z
c₁ = λ s → λ z → s z
c₂ = λ s → λ z → s (s z)
…
#+end_src
That is, each numeral ~n~ is represented as the function
which applies its first argument to its second argument ~n~ times.

Or more neatly, we define
#+begin_src text
zero = λ s → λ z → z
scc = λ n → λ s → λ z → s (n s z)
#+end_src
so then ~c₀~ is ~zero~, ~c₁~ can be obtained from ~scc zero~ (by reducing it),
~c₂~ can be obtained from ~scc (scc zero)~, etc.

** Addition and multiplication

By using the fact that
- “each numeral ~n~ is represented as the function which applies
  its first argument to its second argument ~n~ times”,
we can fairly easily define addition and multiplication.

For addition, ~m + n~,
- we begin with ~n~,
- and apply ~suc~ ~m~-many times.
#+begin_src text
plus = λ m → λ n → λ s → λ z → m s (n s z)
#+end_src

For multiplication, ~m * n~,
- we begin with ~zero~,
- and apply “~plus n~” ~m~-many times.
#+begin_src text
times = λ m → λ n → m (plus n) zero
#+end_src

** Testing for zero

In order to test if a natural number is zero, we use the same ideas,
- but now the base case is true,
- and the function we apply ~m~-many times
  is just the constantly false function.
#+begin_src text
iszro = λ m → m (λ x → fls) tru
#+end_src

* Recursion: the fixed point combinator



** Preamble                                    :ignore:

We have, in the previous section, encoded booleans, pairs
and natural numbers in the untyped λ-calculus.

In the process,
- we defined a “control structure”
  combinator ~test = λ l → λ m → λ n → l m n~
  which acts something like ~if-then-else~.
- we defined functions for deconstructing pairs, ~fst~ and ~snd~,
- and for operating on
  natural numbers: ~scc~, ~plus~, ~times~ and ~iszro~.

But we are still lacking in “easy” ways to define new functions.
- The way we define those functions relies heavily on
  the encoding of the data.
- We perhaps cannot make it truly “easy” in this limited language,
- but we can get “easier”.

** The ω-omega combinator: unbounded recursion

During our discussion of normal forms, we mention the “ω-combinator”,
which embodies /divergence/ (non-termination).
#+begin_src text
omega = (λ x → x x) (λ x → x x)
#+end_src

~omega~ has one redex, and reducing it results in ~omega~ once more.
- So ~omega~ has no normal form, because no reduction sequence
  for ~omega~ terminates.

A generalisation of the ~omega~ combinator will let us
define recursive functions.

** The fixed-point combinator, a.k.a. the Y-combinator

The /fixed-point combinator/, or the (call-by-value) /Y-combinator/,
has the form
#+begin_src text
fix = λ f → (λ x → f (λ y → x x y)) (λ x → f (λ y → x x y))
#+end_src

:TODO: prove that this gives rise to a fixed point

** Recursive definitions via the fixed point combinator

To use ~fix~, we define a function ~g~ of the form
#+begin_src text
g = λ f → …
#+end_src
and use ~f~ as a /recursive call/.

Then we apply ~fix g~, which computes a recursive function
whose right-hand side is given by ~g~.

See Pierce, chapter 5, page 66 for an example involving
a definition of factorial in this manner.

* Enriching the calculus

We may “enrich” our untyped λ-calculus
- first by adding additional values for types such as
  booleans and natural numbers,
  - values which are simply new constants,
    and not encodings as pure untyped functions,
- and by then adding a (simple) type system to obtain a
  (simply) typed λ-calculus.

We will do both of these in section 6 of the notes,
“A typed λ-calculus, /TL/”.
