\section{The purpose of an outline}
\label{sec:org5dd5db4}
\begin{quote}
“A course outline sets the expectations for students
and what they can expect in terms of the course
experience they will receive,
the format in which the course will be delivered
and the knowledge and skills that can be gained.
The outline introduces the course and the instructor
and sets out the expectations of the instructor
so that students are aware of how they will learn,
what level of participation will be expected
and how they will be assessed.”
\end{quote}

\subsection{Lecture recordings}
\label{sec:org4c9b4c6}
Lectures and tutorials will be made available as recordings
shortly after said lectures and tutorials,
via Microsoft Stream (or if Zoom is used, via Zoom).

\subsection{Homework due dates}
\label{sec:org4eee367}
This course will have weekly homeworks, as described in \hyperref[sec:orgecae155]{Grading}.

Homework will be released each Friday by end of day
and will be due the Sunday nine days later by end of day,
unless a delay is announced on the course homepage,
and except for the weekends surrounding the midterm recess
—there will be a single homework due
the Monday following the recess instead.

\subsection{Assignment due dates}
\label{sec:orgfadd0ab}
This course will have three assignments, as described in \hyperref[sec:orgecae155]{Grading}.

As of the beginning of the course,
the assignments are planned to be due on
\begin{itemize}
\item \sout{October 7th},
\begin{itemize}
\item ammended September 27th; the new due date is October 21st
\end{itemize}
\item \sout{November 11th},
\begin{itemize}
\item ammended November 9th; the new due date is \sout{November 25th}
\item ammended once more on November 25th; the final due date is November 29th
\end{itemize}
and
\item \sout{December 16th}.
\begin{itemize}
\item ammended November 19th; the new due date is December 18th.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Any changes to these dates will be announced on the course homepage.
Also see \hyperref[sec:org5e3dda3]{Accomodations for SAS and conflicts with other courses};
in particular, we will reevaluate the final assignment due date
once the exams schedule is released, based on the exam dates
of other third year computer science courses.

\section{Administration tools}
\label{sec:org0a0ab18}
\subsection{The tools}
\label{sec:org9fc22cb}
This course will be administered via a combination of
\begin{itemize}
\item a “team” on the CAS departmental Microsoft Teams,
\begin{itemize}
\item —Zoom meetings may be used if there is a problem with Teams;
any such change will be announced on the homepage—
\end{itemize}
\item the course
\href{https://armkeh.github.io/principles-of-programming-languages/}{homepage},
\item a \href{https://github.com/armkeh/principles-of-programming-languages}{Github repository}
of the course content, from which
the homepage is hosted as a \texttt{github.io} website,
\item a repository for each student on the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca}{McMaster CAS GitLab server}, and
\item communications via McMaster email addresses.
\end{itemize}

Specifically,
\begin{description}
\item[{Teams}] will be used for live lectures/tutorials,
lecture/tutorial recordings,
and preferred for discussions relevant to the whole
(or at least many members of) the class,
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Zoom}}] may be used for live lectures/tutorials
if there are problems with Teams,
\end{description}
\item[{the homepage}] will be used for announcements
and convenient access to notes and homework/assignments,
\item[{the Github repository}] will be used to host the course homepage
and content, and allow students to easily see version changes
to content,
\item[{the Gitlab repository for each student}] will be used
for homework and assignment submissions and grade distribution, and
\item[{McMaster email addresses}] will be used
for private communications with students.
\end{description}

An Avenue to Learn course has been created for this course
for the sake of directing students to the course homepage
and entering homework/assignment deadlines in a calendar.
No course content will be uploaded to Avenue to Learn,
and attempts to communicate with staff on that platform
may go unnoticed and unanswered.

\subsection{Your responsibilities regarding course administration tools}
\label{sec:org462fcea}
\textbf{It is the student's responsibility}
\begin{itemize}
\item to ensure they have an account on
the \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca}{McMaster CAS GitLab server} and
the \href{https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19\%3a1f2f25fdc5e243d285e2f92216e5b483\%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=a2e98537-757f-4791-b72f-2cf4d7459f28\&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772}{CAS Microsoft Teams team}
\item to be aware of the information on the course's \href{https://armkeh.github.io/principles-of-programming-languages/}{homepage} and
\item to check the \href{https://armkeh.github.io/principles-of-programming-languages/}{homepage}, their course GitLab repository,
the Microsoft Teams team for the course
and their email regularly for announcements and changes.
\end{itemize}
It is not assumed that students follow the Github repo,
but it is a good practice to stay informed of any and all
changes to content.

\section{Communicating with course staff}
\label{sec:org01496d0}
To communicate with course staff reliably, you should
choose the most appropriate means from the below.
\begin{itemize}
\item “Mention” the course staff member in a relevant channel on
the Microsoft Teams team.
\begin{itemize}
\item This is appropriate for questions which may interest many students.
\end{itemize}
\item Private message the course staff member on Microsoft Teams.
\begin{itemize}
\item This is appropriate for very quick questions.
\end{itemize}
\item Email the course staff member using the email listed under \hyperref[sec:orgfe629d1]{Course staff}.
\begin{itemize}
\item This is appropriate for longer or more detailed questions.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Note that outside of class hours, course staff may not be available
for immediate replies to your communication.
Permit up to a business day for response before following up
on urgent issues, and up to two business days for non-urgent issues.

\subsection{Asking well-posed questions}
\label{sec:org3fc3a9d}
While there are “no stupid questions”, and course staff are happy
to help with any questions regarding course material,
it is expected that when students ask questions
they will take the time to ask well-posed questions
as described in these resources.
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask}{The computer science StackOverflow guide} to asking good questions.
\item \href{https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2017fa/thoughtful.html}{Asking Technical Questions} by Dr. Clarkson of Cornell University.
\item \href{http://www.catb.org/\~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html}{How to Ask Questions The Smart Way} by Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen.
\end{itemize}

In summary, when asking questions, always take the time to
do your own research first, and describe this research to the staff.
\begin{itemize}
\item For questions regarding course administration,
always check the homepage and the outline first,
and include which sections you have checked in your question.
\item For questions regarding tools, including installation and usage,
always search online first, and list the resources consulted
in your question.
\item For questions regarding course material, always
reference the portions of the notes you have checked
for your answers.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, any time that code is being shared,
students are asked to share plain text or markup code snippets
(in the case of Microsoft Teams, using the code snippet formatting option)
rather than sharing screenshots.

Failure to follow these practices may result in
terse answers from course staff, such as
“Please check the course outline.” 

\section{Resources}

From its abstract:
\begin{quote}
A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the
absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases
according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems
– and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective –
has important applications in software engineering, language design,
high-performance compilers, and security. This text provides a
comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science
and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is
pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming
examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the
needs of implementations
